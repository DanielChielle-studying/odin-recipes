# Recipes from The Odin Project

In this project, I am building a website that displays a collection of recipes. Currently, the project consists of basic **HTML** to create the structure of the site, with no dynamic features or styling yet.

## Features (Current Stage)

- A homepage with a list of recipes.
- Each recipe has a name, description, and basic details.
- Links to individual recipe pages for more information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for creating the website's structure and layout.
